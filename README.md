# Roadmap

This a roadmap repository for the self development. in this repository, I will be documenting my learning journey and the projects I am working on. The goal is to keep track of my progress and share my knowledge with others. each of topic will be create a new issue and I will be updating the issue with my progress. I will also be creating a new branch for each topic and merging it to the main branch once I am done. I will be using the following format for each topic:

## Issue Template

```markdown
# Topic Name

## Description

## Progress

## Resources

## Notes
```
